## [Fastest Editor]

This is how I use my favourite console editor, as an alias in my
.bashrc file, and I would suggest it's the fastest and simplest console
based editor available... both to type and start, and also to save and
quit...

    # alias e
    alias e='nano -t -x -c'

so I type `e filename` to edit something (can't be any simpler than
that) and then control-x to save and quit (I would struggle to suggest
anything quicker and simpler than that too). Use `nano --help` for more
command line suggestions and obviously `man nano` for an extended
explanation of most commands. And here is an example of using a more
complex nano based alias to provide a very simple shell based notes system
which is handy for pasting special commands or any notes you may need later
on...

    # alias n
    alias n='echo -e "\n-- $(date) --\n" >> ~/.note && e +10000 ~/.note'
    alias sn='cat ~/.note'

The first alias above creates a file called `.note` in my home
directory so I can then just type `sn` to see them all (most recent
last) or `tail -n 20 ~/.note` to see the last 20 lines. I first
created these 2 aliases nearly 10 years ago (pre-nano with pico) and still
use them nearly every day.
