# [Minor Updates]

A few minor updates to the [github repo]. The extra RHS dropdown nav menu
has been removed as it had nothing to do with this project. The LUA pages
were part of another repo and depended on a non-standard nginx package with
LUA bindings.

# [MultiHost Setup]

The first **nginx.conf** file was orientated towards running a few different
hosts within the `/home/admin/var/www` area and was easy for a single `admin`
user to manage but it did not allow for different users to safely manage each
vhost with their own uid:gid. So now the current setup uses `/etc/passwd`
based users each with their own website within their own homedir. The current
example setup at [bojax.net] also provides for `ssh`, `sftp` and `rsync`
access to each users web area as well as [chroots] the user so they cannot
see the rest of the system let alone other users sites. The use of `ssh` and
friends replaces `webdav` support which will most like be removed altogether.

# [ownCloud Is Too Heavy]

[![thumbnail][n5_owncloud]][6]

My recent experiments with using ownCloud on a small 128 Mb ram VPS for
general file management shows that it is too slow on such a small server,
even when using `nginx + php5-fpm` and the `SQLite` database backend. Using
`apache + mod_php` and `MySQL` would be out of the question.

# [Double Rainbow]

[![thumbnail][double_rainbow]][5]

[Secondary rainbows] are caused by a double reflection of sunlight inside the
raindrops, and appear at an angle of 50–53°. As a result of the second
reflection, the colours of a secondary rainbow are inverted compared to the
primary bow, with blue on the outside and red on the inside. The secondary
rainbow is fainter than the primary because more light escapes from two
reflections compared to one and because the rainbow itself is spread over a
greater area of the sky. The dark area of unlit sky lying between the primary
and secondary bows is called Alexander's band, after Alexander of Aphrodisias
who first described it.[19]
