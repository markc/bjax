# [ownCloud Is Too Heavy]

My recent experiments with using ownCloud on a small 128 Mb ram VPS for
general file management shows that it is too slow on such a small server,
even when using `nginx + php5-fpm` and the `SQLite` database backend. Using
`apache + mod_php` and `MySQL` would be out of the question.

# [So this is 2014]

A very Happy New Year to anyone reading this posting. This is really just
another test posting to make sure the methods I am describing in the
README.md actually do work.

# [Fastest Editor]

This is how I use my favourite console editor, as an alias in my .bashrc
file, and I would suggest it's the fastest and simplest console based
editor available, both to type and start, and also to save and quit...

# [Courier authProg]

Here is a Bash shell script to handle authentication from the pipe
handler for the Courier-MTA authdaemon. See [README authlib] for more
information on how to use it. On a Debian system it is located at
**/etc/courier/authProg**.

# [No More Ubuntu]

I upgraded this server from Ubuntu Dapper to Debian Etch because of the
`/bin/sh -> /bin/dash` debacle. Things broke because they decided to
change the default shell without ANY warning and no hint that they even
care about the problem. Not on folks. I'll still use Kubuntu for desktops
but not for servers, ever again. Sure I could easily work around it but I
no longer trust Canonical/Ubuntu NOT to pull some stunt like this again
in the future so it's back to good old reliable Debian proper for all my
servers. BTW a simple workaround for anyone still running a post-Dapper
Ubuntu system to retain the previous sane bash as the default shell is to
use **dpkg-reconfigure dash** and deselect it as the default shell.
