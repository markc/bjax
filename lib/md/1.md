# [ownCloud Is Too Heavy]

My recent experiments with using ownCloud on a small 128 Mb ram VPS for
general file management shows that it is too slow on such a small server,
even when using `nginx + php5-fpm` and the `SQLite` database backend. Using
`apache + mod_php` and `MySQL` would be out of the question.

# [So this is 2014]

[Secondary rainbows] are caused by a double reflection of sunlight inside the
raindrops, and appear at an angle of 50–53°. As a result of the second
reflection, the colours of a secondary rainbow are inverted compared to the
primary bow, with blue on the outside and red on the inside. The secondary
rainbow is fainter than the primary because more light escapes from two
reflections compared to one and because the rainbow itself is spread over a
greater area of the sky. The dark area of unlit sky lying between the primary
and secondary bows is called Alexander's band, after Alexander of Aphrodisias
who first described it.[19]
