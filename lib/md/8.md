# [Minor Updates]

_A few minor updates to the [github repo]. The extra RHS dropdown nav menu
has been removed as it had nothing to do with this project. The LUA pages
were part of another repo and depended on a non-standard nginx package with
LUA bindings._

It's really hard to develop sophisticated LUA replacements for so many PHP
based web apps so I've gone back to plain old PHP. The CDN updates were...

- jQuery to 2.1.1
- Bootstrap to 3.2.0
- FontAwesome to 4.2.0
