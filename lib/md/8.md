A very Happy New Year to anyone reading this posting. This is really just
another test posting to make sure the methods I am describing in the
README.md actually do work.

This post was created as such (assuming bash and alias e is used)...

    e `echo "lib/md/$(($(/bin/ls -1v lib/md | tail -n 1 | cut -d. -f 1)+1)).md"`
    cat `echo "lib/md/$(/bin/ls -1v lib/md | tail -n 1 | cut -d. -f 1).md"`
    # prepend the first 2 headings and paragraph to lib/md/1.md + "---"
    git add `echo "lib/md/$(/bin/ls -1v lib/md | tail -n 1 | cut -d. -f 1).md"`
    git commit -a

which could be put into a shell script to mostly automate the procedure.
