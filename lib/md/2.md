## About

Welcome to my personal website where I'll highlight some of my projects
and vent some personal opinions on technical and social issues. This site
is hosted and managed via [GitHub]s incredible Git based project hosting
system which I think is arguably the third most important and useful
online facility after email and Google search. The site is based on
[Bootstrap] using modern mobile-first [HTML5], [CSS3] and [jQuery]
technologies. The source is freely available under a [AGPL-3.0] license
from [Github].

This site is based on the [Bjax] project together with [lua] scripts for
use with the [OpenResty] web server.
