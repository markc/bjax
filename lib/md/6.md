# [ownCloud Is Too Heavy]

My recent experiments with using ownCloud on a small 128 Mb ram VPS for
general file management shows that it is too slow on such a small server,
even when using `nginx + php5-fpm` and the `SQLite` database backend. Using
`apache + mod_php` and `MySQL` would be out of the question.

The idea of being able to use the ownCloud Android app is appealing and it
works well, even auto uploads photos from my Nexus 5, but general usage of
ownCloud is just barely acceptable. This has led me to using `nginx + lua`
via the [OpenResty] project which bundles the standard nginx core plus lots
of 3rd-party nginx modules as well as most of their external dependencies
all in one package. So far the upside is that memory usage is way down on
any PHP combination I've tried except perhaps using lighttpd in pure CGI
mode (not fastcgi) so there is no daemon running to consume ram but the
plain old-school CGI _launch process per invocation_ is in itself too slow.
The downside is learning both Lua, the language, and how it's applied inside
the nginx server.

So as much as I would like to deploy ownCloud everywhere it's just not
feasible on lowend servers and hardware and that is my goal. Unfortunately
there is nothing remotely as good as ownCloud available for the OpenResty
platform, nor any of the superb PHP based apps, but at the very least
ownCloud provides an excellent model to aim for in Lua. RIP ownCloud.
